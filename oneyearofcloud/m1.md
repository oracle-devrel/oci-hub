# Basic concepts refresher


Dear reader,

Our very first Year of Cloud month is dedicated to a gentle introduction to the basics of Oracle Cloud. Let's start with what Oracle Cloud is and what you could do with it:

## Intro
- [Key Concepts and Terminology](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/GSG/Concepts/concepts.htm)
- [Introduction to the key concepts of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure](https://blogs.oracle.com/developers/introduction-to-the-key-concepts-of-oracle-cloud-infrastructure)
- [Building Blocks of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)](https://krrai77.medium.com/building-blocks-of-oracle-cloud-infrastructure-oci-753b07599e7b)
- [Main OCI services](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/GSG/Concepts/baremetalintro.htm)

And of course, we need the official guide (and a nice Youtube playlist guiding you through all the concepts):

- [PDF - OCI User Guide](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/pdf/ug/OCI_User_Guide.pdf)
- [Video: Level 50 - OCI Foundations](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKCk3OyNwIzuHYigVbdtDOZOfChcotfj2)

Or, if you are so inclined, you could go through a hands-on lab with the same goal (we call this kind of workshop [Live Labs](https://apexapps.oracle.com/pls/apex/dbpm/r/livelabs/home). Live Labs allows you to try Oracle Cloud free of charge and learn a technical skill without creating an account - or use your own if you want)

- [Live Labs: Get Started with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Core Services](https://apexapps.oracle.com/pls/apex/dbpm/r/livelabs/view-workshop?wid=648&session=101797632958623)

## Security

We think that cloud infrastructure without thorough and sophisticated security is pretty much useless (and dangerous), so we gave OCI an enterprise-level secure architecture.

- [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Security Architecture](https://www.oracle.com/a/ocom/docs/oracle-cloud-infrastructure-security-architecture.pdf)
- [Video: Basic Security on Oracle Cloud - with Victor Martin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AkS16-8lGok&t=260s)
- [Video: OCI Security](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKCk3OyNwIzs89fq8VzaM6cFIIsvlAIRH)

Privacy and GDPR are also important and pervasive topics for really any kind of workload nowadays.
- [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and the GDPR](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Resources/Assets/whitepapers/oci-gdpr.pdf)
- [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Privacy Features](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Resources/Assets/whitepapers/oci-privacy-features.pdf)

## Key components

Let's start with the basic building blocks, the first one being, of course, the **compute** instances.  

- [Creating a Compute Instance](https://enabling-cloud.github.io/oci-learning/manual/CreatingComputeInstance.html)
- [Launch a Linux VM](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/GSG/Reference/overviewworkflow.htm#Tutorial__Launching_Your_First_Linux_Instance)
- [Launch a Windows VM](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/GSG/Reference/overviewworkflowforWindows.htm#Tutorial__Launching_Your_First_Windows_Instance)

The full curiculla could be seen in this video playlist here (1hr):
- [Video: Compute Level 100](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKCk3OyNwIzsAjIaUaVsKdXcfBOy6LASv)

OCI's **storage** capabilities are quite impressive, so let's have a quickstart with these introductory videos:

- [Video: Storage Level 200](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKCk3OyNwIzs00n96XRb9VOg06GCiPATf)

- [Video: File Storage Level 100](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKCk3OyNwIzuj1RV5J4AIKpCSPyy2gDTA)
- [Video: Block Volume Level 100](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKCk3OyNwIzu51FKMda4X405oK-eIA5uo)
- [Video: Object Storage Level 100](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKCk3OyNwIzu7zNtt_w1dXFOUbAjheMeo)

And a Live Lab, if you want to try it yourself.
- [Live Labs: Create an Object Storage Service](https://apexapps.oracle.com/pls/apex/dbpm/r/livelabs/view-workshop?wid=655&session=101797632958623)

**Networking** is the all important (and often overlooked) component of any cloud service out there, so let's dive into OCI's networking features:

- [Networking Overview](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/overview.htm)
- [Learn OCI Networking in 22 minutes! – Oracle Cloud Blog](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwi9idHay77uAhUil4sKHSVpD_cQFjAGegQIARAC&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oc-blog.com%2F2020%2F05%2F12%2Fawesome-oci-networking-in-the-cloud-youtube-series%2F&usg=AOvVaw2jpEujJXj1VB4GtKQm3DB8)
- [Video: Networking on Oracle Cloud - with Victor Martin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8JoT0-E1Bo&t=55s)

## For developers
If you are a developer, here are some introductory resources for you:

- [Software Development Kits and Command Line Interface](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/sdks.htm#Software_Development_Kits_and_Command_Line_Interface)
- [REST APIs](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/devcloudshellintro.htm#Cloud_Shell)

Find more links and resources in the [Basic orientation](../complexity/basic-orientation.html) section.

## Before you go
... we recommend attending this great introductory Virtual Classroom (it's an instructor-led, 1 hour Zoom class, Bi-weekly, on Tuesdays at 11AM CET):

See you next month,

The Oracle Cloud Team
